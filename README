CheckPt Haskell
---------------

My attempt at a Haskell implementation of my CheckPt project.

It will provide a CLI for managing media items to be consumed (books, movies,
television). The workflow will be optimized for media items as files, but
tangible items such as physical books can be used as well.

Planned Usage
=============
*NOTE*: This stuff is subject to change.

*Show entire list*
checkpt list

*Add a root item*
checkpt add "Fallen Dragon"

*Add a collection if it exists, list it otherwise*
checkpt collection "Mad Men"

* Add a collection and items if it doesn't exist*
checkpt collection "Mad Mayne" "Ep 1" "Ep 2" "Ep 3"

More to come...

Disclaimer
==========
As with all of the various CheckPt implementations I've created, this is mostly
a learning experience for me, so do not expect the file to work (well) unless
otherwise stated.
